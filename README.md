# aoc-2022-go

I started to publish my solutions on day 10. I'll try to keep up with the daily challenges and fill in the gaps (one day).

These are not my first solutions, which are ugly. I publish here only some short solutions. These short solutions don't take care of error handling and are not ideomatic Go.

## Usage

- Go to the day you want to run
- `go run short[1|2].go [example|input].txt`
